#If set to true, the mod creates a new global folder, that is global for your user on your computer.
#The created folders will be:
# <user_home>/.minecraft_global_packs/required_datapacks
# <user_home>/.minecraft_global_packs/optional_datapacks
# <user_home>/.minecraft_global_packs/required_resourcepacks

#This config allows you to add or remove folders or single files as Data-/Resourcepacks
#For that simply specify the file path to the folder/file relative to your .minecraft or instance folder
#With the current config you can place a Datapack into '.minecraft/global_packs/required_data' to force enable a datapack.
